###Live Demo
https://navneethg.github.io/jsonschemaviewer/

###Instructions
Write a JSON schema (refs supported) in the editor and click 'Visualize' to visualize it using a collapsible tree.
This project as of now is simply a rip off of https://github.com/jlblcc/json-schema-viewer with reduced functionality. Will rewrite soon.
